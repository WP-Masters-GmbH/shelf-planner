= Why use this plugin? =
 
Whether you produce your own products, drop-ship, or buy through wholesale, you want to track the profitability of your products and your store. 
To do this, you’ll need to manage the cost price of your products.

These Cost Prices (sometimes referred to as ‘direct costs’) are called the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) and we have integrated dedicated fields to manage these in your WooCommerce product pages. 

= What is COGS and how does it help me? = 
 
COGS is sometimes also referred to as ‘cost of sales’ or ‘cost of merchandise’ but in short it refers to the production or purchase costs for products sold in your store. 

Technically, these costs are an expense of your business, and in the end they reduce the revenue your store makes from selling. 

So far not a big deal, but once your business grows, it might get tricky to keep track of profitability all of your products.

This plugin allows you to plan, simulate and summarise both your costs, stock value and margins in one place in the WooCommerce product pages so you get an instant overview of how your business is doing.


= For Merchants, By Merchants =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I would like to see more history in my charts, is this possible? =

Yes! We are working on an automatic import of all historic data and this will be part of a future release.
The way we calculate margin and profitability is slightly different from how some of the standard calculations are done in WooCommerce. If you want to see historical reports, please check out our Shelf Planner plugin with lots more features, including historical profitability reports.

Yes! Good news is, this plugin has it's own API and it has no interaction with frontend or theme. Moreover, every part of this plugin is modular and hookable.
