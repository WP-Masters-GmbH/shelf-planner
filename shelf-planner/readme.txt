== Description ==
Inventory Management, Demand Forecasting, Replenishment and Order Management for WooCommerce, all in one powerful tool. 

Shelf Planner solves a retailer’s costliest problem: accurately predicting customer's demand for hundreds of products every day.
Our forecasting engine analyses your store’s historical and daily sales, as well as external data sets that factor for local events, news trends, holidays, even school schedules and creates a live order recommendation for every product, every day of the week.

= How Does it Work? =
Shelf Planner is an automated forecasting and prediction engine for WooCommerce that recommends how much to order for all products for every day of the week. We use machine learning and advanced forecasting logics and create replenishment and order recommendations based on true demand from your customers.

= Sales Go Up =
Understock situations lead to missed sales opportunities.
Because Shelf Planner uses a so called ‘ideal stock’, based on a more accurate sales forecast, Out-of-Stock situations are reduced and sales increases.

= Profits Go Up = 
Overstock situation will ultimately lead to forced markdown and clearances, which is weighing heavy on your net margin and profitability.
By reducing overstock situations, sell through at full price increases and net margin improves.

= Can I get more frequent updates on my sales forecast than a weekly sales forecast? =
Yes, you can. The Sales Forecast is calculated with live data, but we update the sales forecast for your store only once per week, every Monday morning.
However, if you want to update the forecast on demand, you can do this in the 'Integrations' and 'Update Forecast Data'.

= Why do I need to map my categories? =
Mapping your categories allows us to compare performance of your products to standardised categories and recognise certain patterns and trends.
Our plugin will work without mapping categories, but the forecast will be more accurate if they are.
